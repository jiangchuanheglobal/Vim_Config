This directory contains files to automatically compute the indent for a type of file.

If you want to add your own indent file for your personal use, read the docs at “:help indent-expression”.

Note: If you want to make an indent file, it should be named for the filetype that you want, not the extension. For example, if you want to change your Javascript indentation, your file should be named javascript.vim, not js.vim.
